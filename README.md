:question: **What is this Repository About?**

The DI pattern enables a seamless adaptation process for our tests amidst technological changes, ensuring longevity and ease of maintenance. But the discussion doesn't end there; the Service Locator pattern plays its own crucial role. While sometimes viewed skeptically, the Service Locator shines in specific contexts, particularly in developing plugin architectures for automated testing libraries. It offers a centralized way to manage dependencies, simplifying configuration and retrieval in complex scenarios.

**What Will You Gain?**

-   **Adapting to Technological Shifts with Dependency Injection:** Learn how the DI pattern can make your testing framework resilient against changes in technology, keeping your tests clean and maintainable.
-   **Harnessing the Service Locator for Flexible Dependency Management:** Discover the benefits of the Service Locator pattern in creating flexible, plugin-based architectures for your automated testing libraries.
-   **Crafting Future-Proof Automated Testing Frameworks:** Explore how combining Dependency Injection and the Service Locator pattern can lead to more robust, adaptable, and clean testing frameworks.

**:key: What are Dependency Injection and the Service Locator Pattern?**

-   **Dependency Injection:** A design pattern that allows a program to remove hard-coded dependencies and makes it possible to change them, either at runtime or compile time. This approach significantly enhances the flexibility and testability of the code.
-   **Service Locator Pattern:** Often used as an alternative to DI, the Service Locator pattern centralizes the management of dependencies. It allows for the dynamic retrieval of dependencies, offering flexibility and reducing coupling in complex automated testing scenarios.

### Steps to Run Tests Locally in Visual Studio with C#

1. **Open the Project:** Launch Visual Studio and open your C# project.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - **Single Test Method:** Right-click on the test method name > `Run Tests`.
   - **All Tests in a Test Class:** Right-click on the test class file > `Run Tests`.

### Running Tests on LambdaTest

To execute tests on LambdaTest, you need to set up environment variables in your Visual Studio test configurations:

- `LT_USERNAME` with your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY` with your LambdaTest access key.

### Configuring Test Settings in Visual Studio

1. **Access Test Settings:** Navigate to `Test` > `Configure Run Settings` > `Select Solution Wide runsettings File` for broader configurations or use the `Test Explorer` context menu for specific settings.
2. **Set Environment Variables:** In your `.runsettings` file or through the Test Explorer context menu, add your LambdaTest credentials.
   - Include `<EnvironmentVariables>` in your `.runsettings` file with `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` values.

### Viewing Test Results

Test results are available in the `Test Explorer` window, providing information on passed and failed tests, execution times, and detailed error messages.
